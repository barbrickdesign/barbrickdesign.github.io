## 🔐 SECURITY LAYER HIERARCHY

### **Layer 1: Wallet Authentication (PRIMARY)**
**Purpose:** Universal access for most contracts and operations
**Access Level:** PUBLIC → SECRET
**Use Cases:**
- Standard government contracts
- Unclassified/CONFIDENTIAL/SECRET work
- Contractor payments
- Public investment
- Team collaboration
- Most daily operations

**Authentication Method:**
- Connect Phantom/MetaMask wallet
- Sign message to prove ownership
- Instant verification via blockchain
- Session management
- No physical hardware needed

**Contract Access:**
- ✅ Public contracts (unlimited)
- ✅ CONFIDENTIAL contracts ($18M)
- ✅ SECRET contracts ($63M)
- ❌ TOP SECRET (requires Layer 2)
- ❌ TS/SCI (requires Layer 2)

**Advantages:**
- Instant access (no delays)
- Works globally (anywhere)
- No hardware required
- Easy onboarding
- Blockchain-verified
- Cost: $0

---

### **Layer 2: PIV/CAC Authentication (SECONDARY)**
**Purpose:** Additional verification for highest security levels
**Access Level:** TOP SECRET → TS/SCI
**Use Cases:**
- TOP SECRET contracts
- TS/SCI compartmented information
- Special access programs
- Critical infrastructure projects
- Nuclear/defense systems
- Intelligence operations

**Authentication Method:**
- Connect wallet (Layer 1) FIRST
- Then insert PIV/CAC card
- Dual verification required
- Hardware + crypto security
- Enhanced audit trail

**Contract Access:**
- ✅ All Layer 1 contracts
- ✅ TOP SECRET contracts ($112M)
- ✅ TS/SCI contracts ($52M)
- ✅ Special Access Programs
- ✅ Compartmented intel

**Advantages:**
- Maximum security
- Dual verification
- Government compliance
- Physical + digital proof
- Complete audit trail

## 🎯 IMPLEMENTATION ARCHITECTURE

### **Authentication Flow:**

```
User Action → Wallet Connect (Layer 1)
              ↓
         Check Clearance
              ↓
    ┌──────────────────────┐
    │                      │
SECRET or lower      TOP SECRET/TS/SCI
    │                      │
    ↓                      ↓
GRANTED          Requires PIV/CAC
(Instant)            (Layer 2)
                         ↓
                   Insert Card
                         ↓
                   Verify Both
                         ↓
                     GRANTED
                  (Enhanced)
```

### **Code Structure:**

```javascript
class MultiLayerSecurity {
    constructor() {
        this.layer1 = new WalletAuth();      // Primary
        this.layer2 = new PIVCACAuth();      // Secondary
        this.currentLayers = [];
    }
    
    async authenticate(targetClearance) {
        // Layer 1: Always required
        const wallet = await this.layer1.connect();
        if (!wallet.success) {
            throw new Error('Layer 1 (Wallet) auth failed');
        }
        
        this.currentLayers.push('WALLET');
        
        // Check if Layer 2 needed
        if (this.requiresLayer2(targetClearance)) {
            const card = await this.layer2.readCard();
            if (!card.success) {
                throw new Error('Layer 2 (PIV/CAC) required but failed');
            }
            this.currentLayers.push('PIV_CAC');
        }
        
        return {
            success: true,
            layers: this.currentLayers,
            clearance: this.determineClearance()
        };
    }
    
    requiresLayer2(clearance) {
        return ['TOP_SECRET', 'TS_SCI'].includes(clearance);
    }
}
