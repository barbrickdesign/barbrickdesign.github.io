## üîç Technical Details

### Wallet Tracker Module

**Detection Algorithms**:

1. **Exit Wallet Pattern**
   - Received > 90% of victim's outflows
   - Low subsequent outflows (< 10 transactions)
   - Holding significant balance

2. **Mixer Pattern**
   - Many small inflows (> 20 transactions)
   - Few large outflows (< 5 transactions)
   - Suspicious score +40

3. **Scam Pattern**
   - Large deposits followed by rapid drain
   - Round number transfers
   - Timing patterns (< 10 sec between txs)

4. **Dead Wallet Criteria**
   - Balance between 0.002 and 0.003 SOL
   - No recent activity (configurable threshold)
   - Likely rent dust or abandoned wallets

### Suspicious Scoring System

| Pattern | Score Weight |
|---------|-------------|
| Large transfer (> 10 SOL) | +2 per SOL (max 30) |
| Possible exit wallet | +50 |
| Possible mixer | +40 |
| Scam pattern detected | +80 |
| Round number transfer | +5 |

**Thresholds**:
- Score < 30: Low risk
- Score 30-50: Medium risk  
- Score 50-80: High risk
- Score > 80: Very high risk (likely scam)

### Transaction Analysis

**Depth Levels**:
- **Depth 0**: Single wallet only
- **Depth 1**: Wallet + direct connections
- **Depth 2**: Wallet + 2 levels of connections (default)
- **Depth 3**: Full network graph (resource intensive)

**Performance**:
- Average scan time: 30-60 seconds (depth 2)
- Transaction limit: 100 per wallet
- Connected wallet limit: Top 20 by balance

## üìä Recovery Statistics

### Solana Network

**Average Recoverable per Wallet**:
- Empty accounts: 5-15 accounts = 0.0102-0.0306 SOL
- Dead wallets: 0.002-0.003 SOL each
- Dust tokens: $0.05-$0.50 value

**Estimated Total Value**:
- If 1,000 wallets √ó 10 empty accounts = 20.4 SOL
- At $100/SOL = **$2,040 recoverable**

### Dead Wallet Statistics

Research shows:
- ~15% of Solana wallets are dead (inactive > 180 days)
- Average dead wallet balance: 0.0025 SOL
- Total locked in dead wallets: Millions of SOL

**0.002 SOL Threshold**:
- This is the minimum rent for a single account
- Many users abandon wallets with just rent dust
- Our scanner identifies these for bulk recovery
