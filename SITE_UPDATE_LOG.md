## How to Update the "Last Updated" Timestamp

The timestamp on the main index.html page is now **STATIC** and serves as a deployment verification log. It does NOT update automatically on page reload.

### When to Update:
- After pushing any changes to GitHub
- After successful GitHub Pages deployment
- When you want to verify that the latest changes are live

### How to Update:

1. **Open the file:** `index.html` (main site root)
2. **Find this code around line 552:**
   ```javascript
   const lastUpdated = 'Oct 17, 2025, 4:48:39 AM';
   ```
3. **Replace with current date/time:**
   ```javascript
   const lastUpdated = 'CURRENT_DATE_TIME_HERE';
   ```
4. **Commit and push to GitHub**
5. **Wait for GitHub Pages deployment**
6. **Check the main page** - the timestamp should now show your update time

### Format:
Use this format: `'Oct 17, 2025, 4:48:39 AM'`

### Why This Works:
- Static timestamp doesn't change on reload
- Shows when the site was last updated/deployed
- Easy to verify GitHub Pages deployment success
- Manual update ensures accuracy

### Example Updates:
- `'Oct 17, 2025, 4:48:39 AM'` - Agent Hub reorganization complete
- `'Oct 18, 2025, 2:30:15 PM'` - New feature deployment
- `'Oct 19, 2025, 9:15:22 AM'` - Bug fixes deployed

## Quick Update Command:
```bash
# Update timestamp in index.html
sed -i "s/const lastUpdated = '.*';/const lastUpdated = '$(date '+%b %d, %Y, %I:%M:%S %p')';/" index.html
```

This timestamp helps you verify that your GitHub Pages deployments are working correctly!
