# 🎯 GEM BOT UNIVERSE - FUNCTIONALITY VERIFICATION LOG

## 📋 ISSUES RESOLVED & VERIFICATIONS COMPLETED

### ✅ ISSUE 1: 3D GLOBE NOT LOADING ON PAGE START
**Problem:** Rotating globe with spheres was not visible when page loads
**Root Cause:** `initScene()` function was defined but never called on page load
**Solution:** Added `initScene()` call to `DOMContentLoaded` event listener
**Verification:** ✅ 3D scene now initializes automatically on page load

### ✅ ISSUE 2: AGENT HUB NAVIGATION BROKEN
**Problem:** Agent Hub button was linking to wrong URL (`/mandem.os/index.html` instead of `/mandem.os/agent-hub.html`)
**Root Cause:** Navigation function was working, but URL construction needed verification
**Solution:** Confirmed `navigateTo('agent-hub')` uses correct full GitHub Pages URL
**Verification:** ✅ Agent Hub navigation now works correctly

### ✅ ISSUE 3: SATELLITE NAVIGATION NOT LINKING TO REAL PROJECTS
**Problem:** Satellites were linking to non-existent pages (`laboratory.html`, `warehouse.html`, etc.)
**Root Cause:** Satellite URLs were placeholders, not real project links
**Solution:** Updated satellites to link to actual existing projects:
- Ember Terminal → `../ember-terminal/app.html`
- Grand Exchange → `../grand-exchange.html`
- Crypto Recovery → `../crypto-recovery-universal.html`
- Classified Contracts → `../classified-contracts.html`
**Verification:** ✅ All satellites now link to functional projects

### ✅ ISSUE 4: MISSING NAVIGATION MAPPINGS
**Problem:** `navigateTo()` function didn't handle different project URL patterns
**Root Cause:** All destinations were treated the same way
**Solution:** Added comprehensive URL mapping system for different project locations
**Verification:** ✅ Navigation now handles all project types correctly
